This is **flibitBounties**, a repository where I host various mini-projects available to work on in exchange for some money and real-world experience.

To view the available bounties, simply click the Issues tab above and have a look!

All of the bounties listed have the following common rules:

**#1: All source code written is yours to keep.** This is NOT a [work for hire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_for_hire); you will retain full copyright ownership of the code you write. All I am asking is that we get the right to use/publish that code under the license used by the project. For example, if a project is released under zlib, we get to use that code under zlib until we decide to change the license, at which point we will ask you for permission to do so first. If you decide that code you wrote is useful for some proprietary project and it makes you a zillion dollars, fine by me!

**#2: You are more than welcome to write your work on completed bounties as professional work experience.** If you contribute to, for example, MojoShader, feel free to put that contribution down on your resume or what have you. If we end up establishing a regular working relationship I am also happy to act as a professional reference for job applications. Because my financial budget for bounties is extremely limited, this is the least I can do while also not going full ["For Exposure"](https://twitter.com/forexposure_txt) on aspiring programmers.

**#3: You are free to work on the project however you like.** If you do a lot of programming on Twitch, for example, you can stream the whole process, and you can publish anything about the project you want, including technical write-ups and example projects. You can also work in whatever environment you want, as long as the final product works on the expected platforms with the expected languages/dependencies. Note, however, that the bounties are based on an expected schedule/timeline/budget and those are unlikely to change without a very detailed assessment explaining, for example, why a project will take longer than expected.

**#4: Every single project listed has a direct connection to a real-world application.** My projects don't live in a bubble; if I need something done it's because there's a game out there _right now_ that needs it. If you want to work on something that involves real commercial applications, this is a good way to do so from the outside. I will do my best to list the most relevant games that apply to a specific project.

**#5: All bounties exclude extra money needed for sample games.** For example, if you're working on something that requires testing a game on Steam you don't have, I'm willing to add an extra bonus to cover the costs of _one game_ on Steam/Itch/GOG to make sure you have access to _real_ data instead of just random unit tests.

**#6: You are responsible for taxable income made from these bounties.** This one's pretty obvious but for those who aren't familiar, this is effectively non-employee income and you will need to pay your own taxes (depending on where you live). In the United States, for example, this is simply ["Other Income" on line 21 of Form 1040](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf). The exception to this rule is if you live in the United States and make more than $600 from my projects, at which point I will need [Form W-9](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf) sent to me so I can send you a 1099-MISC next year.

**#7: If you would like to contribute to the bounty's payout, you are free to do so.** For example, if you're a developer that cannot work on a project but would like to pay extra to the person that completes it, you can simply add that as a comment to the bounty. All the above rules still apply, so you may end up getting multiple 1099-MISCs if you receive bounties from multiple companies.
